## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Real-time chat/messaging | Not core to intelligence workflow |
| Mobile app | Web-first; desktop reps are the primary users |
| States beyond California | MVP scoped to CA districts only |

| Analytics/reporting dashboards | Defer until usage patterns emerge |
| Tenant management UI | Deferred to v2; handled via super-admin |
